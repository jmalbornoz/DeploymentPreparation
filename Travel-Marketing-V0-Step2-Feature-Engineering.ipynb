    "The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict which customers of a travel agency are going to be repeat customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this important? \n",
    "\n",
    "The travel agency is giving out too many discounted packages without ROI - they want to send discounted offers only to customers that will repeat. On the other hand, they want to reduce churn by sending targeted marketing to customers who defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the objective of the machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to identify customers that will repeat using data describing each customer's socioeconomic status and interests. \n",

    "It is important to note that we are engineering variables with the idea of deploying the model. Therefore, from now on, for each step that includes some element of randomness, it is extremely important that we **set the seed**. This way, we can obtain reproducibility between our research and our development code."
