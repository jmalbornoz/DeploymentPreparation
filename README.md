# DeploymentPreparation
These notebooks illustrate the process associated to preparing a machine learning model for production.

There will be a notebook for each one of the Machine Learning Pipeline steps:

1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Building

** The purpose of these notebooks is to provide an idea of the steps that must be covered when preparing a machine learning model for deployment.** For this reason some of the pre-processing and modeling decisions are arbitrary - in a real-world scenario the considerations related to the construction of the preprocessing and modeling pipelines could be entirely different.

## Business use case to be addressed: Predicting Repeat Customers in the Travel Business

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict which customers of a travel agency are going to be repeat customers. 

### Why is this important? 

The travel agency is giving out too many discounted packages without ROI - they want to send discounted offers only to customers that will repeat. On the other hand, they want to reduce churn by sending targeted marketing to customers who are likely to defect.

### What is the objective of the machine learning model?

We aim to identify customers that will repeat using data describing each customer's socioeconomic status and interests.

The dataset used in this project as well as a data dictionary are provided.
